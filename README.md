# Shop.co Marketplace

### **Project Overview**

This project is a fully functional, responsive e-commerce marketplace website built during a 7-day hackathon. The website is powered by **Next.js** for the frontend and **Sanity** as the backend/headless CMS. It features seamless data fetching, a dynamic user interface, and optimized performance.

This was my first hackathon, and the experience was invaluable. I faced real-world challenges, such as handling complex data-fetching workflows, debugging issues, and implementing scalable solutionsâ€”all while adhering to a strict deadline.
